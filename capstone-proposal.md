# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

Discover the world of coffee in London!
The place to go for finding speciality coffee in London. Visualise the best coffee shops on a map, or in list view, keep track of where you've visited and where you'd like to go next. Unlock achievements, rate the places you've been and even add your own.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

For people who love speciality and independent coffee, it can be hard to discover new places, keep track of the places you love and have fun while doing it!

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

The app is for coffee lovers or those who want to discover more. They may want to find good coffee in a certain part of the city or simply keep a note of the best places they've been.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

- FIND coffee shops - use the app's map or list function to see great coffee shops and where they are
- TRACK the spots you've visited - like a scratch map or sticker collection
- RATE them - give a review and a rating on our 1-5 coffee bean scale

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.

- Location services - check in at coffee shops for extra achievements/rewards, find places close to where you are, AR featues unlocked on check in.
- Add friends - see where your friends have visited, comment/message/interact with them, some sort of leaderboard, see other's reviews. Like Strava for coffee drinkers!
- Earn points & discounts to use in store, QR code to scan and earn achievements when you buy something in store
- Check user submitted entries and add to core database
- Scratch map/sticker book design for achievements
